                                 CS 61B  Lab 8
                               March 13-14, 2014

Show your TA your module design (class, modules, and interfaces) for Project 2.
If your partners are in different labs, they will need to get the project
checked off separately by their TAs as well.  You may use the rest of the lab
to work on your project.  When your TA is finished with check-offs, you may use
this as an opportunity to ask the TA or lab assistant any questions you have
about the project.

If you wish to continue working when your lab time ends, please move to another
room (unless yours is the last lab of the day).

Check-off
---------
4 points:  Show your TA the complete documentation of the modules and
           interfaces for your project.

This is an all-or-nothing lab; any reasonable attempt will garner 4 points.
