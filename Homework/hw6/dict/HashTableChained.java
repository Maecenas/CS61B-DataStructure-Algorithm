/**
 *  HashTableChained implements a Dictionary as a hash table with chaining.
 *  All objects used as keys must have a valid hashCode() method, which is
 *  used to determine which bucket of the hash table an entry is stored in.
 *  Each object's hashCode() is presumed to return an int between
 *  Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE.  The HashTableChained class
 *  implements only the compression function, which maps the hash code to
 *  a bucket in the table's range.
